Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing.
Oliver is afraid of heights.
Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness.
Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.
Can you figure out who likes what?

The Good Life

Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.
Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
Bear is getting some exercise.
Can you figure out what each pooch is doing?

Presidents Day.

George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.
•	George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s and William’s is after Abe’s.
•	John is two days older than Abe.
•	Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.
Can you figure out whose birthday is on each day?

The long and the Short of it.
Here’s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
•	Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
•	Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
•	Benito is not the shortest.
Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?
Child	Leisha	Benito	Delia	Charlotte	Weldon	Zina
