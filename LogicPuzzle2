Logic Puzzle 2
The Good Life

Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.
•	Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
•	Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
•	One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
•	A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
•	Bear is getting some exercise.
Can you figure out what each pooch is doing?

	Saber	Ginger	Nutmeg	Pepper	Bear
ears scratched	o	x	o	o	o
playing catch	o	o	o	o	x
taking a nap	x	o	o	o	o
burying a chew toy	o	o	o	x	o
going for a walk	o	o	x	o	o

In this puzzle I started with the first two parameters and the last two which gave away Pepper and Bear’s activity. Bear is not taking a walk but gaining exercise meaning he is playing catch. Peper cannot be playing catch because Bear is, so she is burying a chew toy. Ginger and Saber are not taking a walk and Bear is marked as playing catch leaving Nutmeg open for the walk. Ginger and Saber are the only two dogs left open and the third parameter states that a dog named after a spice is getting its ears scratched (Ginger). With all other selections taken Saber is the one taking the nap.
