Logic Puzzle 3
Presidents Day.

George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.
•	George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s and William’s is after Abe’s.
•	John is two days older than Abe.
•	Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.
Can you figure out whose birthday is on each day?

	Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Friday
George	o	o	o	o	X Week Before
William	o	x	o	o	o
John	o	o	x	o	o
Abe	x	o	o	o	o
Millard	o	o	o	x	o

This puzzle started out difficult until I dissected the first line, they all have birthdays on consecutive days and the weekends are not included. This means that the only days of relevance were Monday through Friday and does not specify the order of the days. Now using the first and third we can place Millard as being on a Thursday automatically. George is as many days before, there are 4 days from Monday to Thursday. (It was at this time I remember my Freshman History Teacher asking the class this question 20+ years ago) Count 4 days (Weekend Not Included) George is on a Friday (last Week). After this the second half of the first Parameter and the second parameter puts Abe as first, William is second, and John in third. With Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday open the group fit in this order. Abe for Monday, William for Tuesday, and John on Wednesday. Fun Fact: Most of our presidents were born on a Sunday and a Tuesday.
