Logic Puzzle 1
Summer Camp

Abigail, Oliver, Rosa, and Blake all attend the same summer camp, where they can cook, kayak, rock climb, and zip-line. Each child has a different favorite activity.
•	Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing.
•	Oliver is afraid of heights.
•	Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness.
•	Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.
Can you figure out who likes what?

When the team worked on this puzzle, we did not use the chart above but came to the same process. Looking at the clues Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times which excluded him from all activities except for cooking. We then moved on to Oliver who is afraid of heights, since Rock Climbing and Zip lining involves heights, they were removed, and Blake is already is a Cook, this leaves Kayak. Abigail’s clue states that she isn’t rock climbing, which leaves Zip Line for her. Since Rosa and Rock Climbing are the only two left, the answer is apparent even without her clue.
